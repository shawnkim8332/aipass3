# Common Coding Principle

1. Variable Names
    - use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).
    - All names start with a letter.

2. Spaces Around Operators
    - Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas

3. Code Indentation
    - Always use 4 spaces for indentation of code blocks

4. Simple Statement Rules
    - Always end a simple statement with a semicolon

5. Complex Statement Rules
    - Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
    - Use one space before the opening bracket.
    - Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
    - Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.

6. Object Rules
    - Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.
    - Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
    - Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.
    - Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.
    - Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
    - Always end an object definition with a semicolon.

7. Line Length
    - For readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characters.
      If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator or a comma.

8. Loading JavaScript in HTML
    - Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary)

9. Use Lower Case File Names
